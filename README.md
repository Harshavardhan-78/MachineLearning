## 📌 Projects Overview

### 1️⃣ Salary Prediction using Linear Regression
- Predicts **salary based on years of experience**
- Demonstrates **supervised learning (regression)**
- Helps understand how a simple linear model learns relationships from data

### 2️⃣ Car Price Prediction using Feature Analysis
- Predicts **car prices** using multiple automobile features
- Includes **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **feature engineering**
- Shows how feature correlation impacts model performance
